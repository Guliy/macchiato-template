## Contributing & Customizing

Take a look at the open issues, especially ones marked as `help wanted`. If you see one you'd like to address don't hesitate to start a discussion or submit a pull request.

If the template isn't doing quite what you're looking for, it's easy to create a local copy of your own following these simple steps:

```
git clone https://github.com/macchiato-framework/macchiato-template.git
cd macchiato-template
lein install
```

If you feel that your customizations are general enough to be useful for others then please consider making a pull request.
